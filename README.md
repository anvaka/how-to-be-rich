# How to Be Rich

A daily practice in exploring true wealth. Visit [how-to-be-rich.com](https://how-to-be-rich.com) to start your journey.

## What is this?

One day while scrolling through TikTok, I came across a video where someone was listing all the ways they wanted to be rich:

* Rich in *time*
* Rich in *love*
* Rich in *family* 
* Rich in *health*
* Rich in *gratitude*
* Rich in *experiences*
* ... and so much more

It got me thinking - I want to be rich too, but not just in the conventional sense. This website is my exploration of true wealth, designed as a daily practice to help us become richer in all the ways that truly matter.

## How to Use

1. Visit the website daily
2. Either choose an area to focus on or use the "random" picker
3. Take it slow - don't try to read everything at once
4. Practice becoming richer in one area at a time

## Available Wealth Areas

* Time
* Experiences
* Connection
* Purpose
* Creativity
* Adventure
* Love
* Family
* Health
* Gratitude
* Blessings
* Mind
* Knowledge
* Wisdom
* Happiness
* Curiosity
* Kindness
* Empathy
* Contentment
* Resilience

## Philosophy

This website is meant to be visited daily, not consumed all at once. Think of it as a daily vitamin for your soul - pick one area to focus on and let it guide your day. True wealth isn't built overnight, but through consistent, mindful practice.

## Technical Details

The website uses vanilla JavaScript and CSS variables for theming, including dark mode support. Each wealth area has its own dedicated page with practical tips and expandable sections for deeper exploration.
